        ## Advanced Software Engineering - Winter semester 2018/29
        
        [Master Data Science](https://studiengang.beuth-hochschule.de/ds-master/)  | [Prof. Edlich](https://github.com/edlich)
        
        ##  Task
        
        A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. You might want to use a language as Python which is also good for this Master! The Code can be relatively simple (as a simple game with console output).
        
        B) Make sure each Person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture.
        
        Please give me a hint as a checklist with one sentence for each 1-9 where I can find the info for points 1-9!!
        
        The contribution in Moodle is just a Link to GitHub in the comment section (@edlich).
        
        The complete documentation must be found in the GitHub doc (e.g. ReadMe or Wiki). It should explain also B in three pages.
