Task
----

A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. You might want to use a language as Python which is also good for this Master! The Code can be relatively simple (as a simple game with console output).

*My pet project in version 0.9 gets some data from strava.com via the strava api and creates as a first simple function a map with some geocoordinates.*
Link to the map: https://kwbln.github.io/my_map.html

B) Make sure each Person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture. Please give me a hint as a checklist with one sentence for each 1-9 where I can find the info for points 1-9!!

*All parts can be found in the github project wiki: https://github.com/kwbln/AdvSE/wiki*

The complete documentation must be found in the GitHub doc (e.g. ReadMe or Wiki). It should explain also B in three pages.
