## Advanced Software Engineering - Winter semester 2018/29

[Master Data Science](https://studiengang.beuth-hochschule.de/ds-master/)  | [Prof. Edlich](https://github.com/edlich)

##  Task

A) Write a small pet project to get into coding again. You might want to use a language as Python which is also good for this Master! The Code can be relatively simple (as a simple game with console output).

B) Make sure each Person has applied the following topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture.

Please give me a hint as a checklist with one sentence for each 1-9 where I can find the info for points 1-9!!

The contribution in Moodle is just a Link to GitHub in the comment section (@edlich).

The complete documentation must be found in the GitHub doc (e.g. ReadMe or Wiki). It should explain also B in three pages.
